Hello to old and new friends. Welcome to my new blog!

Here, I'll be sharing thoughts on things that interest me, like coding, business, and life improvement in general.

Today, I'm going to share how I created this blog. My first idea was to use Wordpress. However, while using it, I realized that I needed something more open. Then, after a bit of googling, I found this amazing tool called “Jekyll”.

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby, very popular to build blogs and portfolios for example.

With Jekyll, you can host your website on GitHub for free. This blog for example is hosted directly from my GitHub repository!

That's it for today. Thanks for visiting!

See you soon!
