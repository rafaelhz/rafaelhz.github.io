About me

My name is Rafael Zeffa, Iâ€™m a Brazilian software developer who enjoys building innovative applications using cutting-edge technologies.

I'm passionate about writing clean code and agile development processes. My favorite languages are Java and Javascript.

In my free time, I enjoy running, playing soccer, and having barbecue with my family and friends ;)

If you have a doubt or just want to talk about technology, feel free to contact me. It will be a pleasure!
